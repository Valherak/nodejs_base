# nodejs_base
Node.JS web-app - EJS based Express

WTF is that ? The result of:


adding the latest express-generator module for all my projects
> npm install express-generator -g

creating a base node.js project with express 4, based on ejs templates ejs 
> express --ejs "project name"

deleting manually unused modules installed by express-generator

browsing into this folder
> cd "project name"

and then, downloading all modules
> npm install


Here you go
